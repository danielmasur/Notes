#### Manufactured from High Emissions

- Fly to each system type you’re farming.
- Scan nav beacon
- Re enter supercruise, head to the high grade emission signal source. You want at least 25 minutes remaining on the source.
- Exit supercruise at the source. There will be between 3-6 targets, each providing 3 of a particular material.
- Collect materials
- When complete, EXIT game completely, not log off to main menu.
- Re-enter game, and back into same mode you just left (open, private, solo).
- Enter supercruise and stop immediately (speed 0 as soon as you see the countdown to enter supercruise, do not exit supercruise)
- Open nav panel, there will be an undiscovered signal source right behind you.
- Head to signal source, it’s the same one you left, but restocked with targets to collect.
- Rinse and repeat until the timer runs out on the signal source, or you have hit the limit of the amount you can carry.

### Raw

Method 1:
Koli Discii C6A
DSS the planet.
Goto Crashed Ship.
Farm mats at the crashed anaconda, Antimony, Ruthenium, Tellurium, Tungsten, Zirconium. Shoot the cargo racks to get up to 2 different items.
Relog farm.

Method 2:
Goto HIP 36601 (1500ly from the bubble)

## Ranks grind
### Empire
Data missions from [Ngalinn](https://inara.cz/galaxy-station/37051/) to [Mainani](https://inara.cz/galaxy-station/35821/) and back again
Or: imperium iss hip 10716 und wu guandi

### Federation
Grind Ceos <-> Sothis missions, with Cargo

Ceos:

- Brunel Hub
- New Dawn Station
- Babbage Gateway

Sothis:

- Dons Inheritance
- Newholm Station


Or:

OCHOSI TRIANGLE

Jump to Chakpa System, Chargaff Installation Station
Take missions from any Federation faction (has emblem under mission count) going to 

Ochosi or 

HIP 67882 - Adams Station ONLY (Others are 80k+ away)

Also pick up missions if they deliver to one of the following factions:

- Partnership of HIP 67086
- Workers of HIP 67882 Democrats
- Chakpa Purple Travel Exchange

After leaving Chargaff Installation go to Williams Dock and get the same missions

After that, go to:

Ochosi - Perry's Folly The only station.

Deliver the missions you have, repeat on grabbing missions from there to one of the other two systems.  Get in a good rythm and watch the Federation Rank climb.

Might even Take missions for Adams Station at Hip 67882

Chapka: Chargaff -> Chapka: Williams Dock -> Ochosi: Perry's Folly -> Hip 67882 Adams Station
